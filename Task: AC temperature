Task: AC temperature

Manual Method: Control using remote

Why it should be Automated: I feel like this should be automated as people loose their AC remotes a lot. Also, if the AC could be automated, then we could make it automatically turn off after the room reaches a user defined temperature to save electricity, lower user spendings and increase overall efficiency.
